- Introduction: In this game, we create a tilting board game which allows players to control the main character (a marble prince) by adjusting the angle and inclination of the board. To increase our game's scope, we design the board as a two-part maze. Inside the maze, the player can collect different items and try to find the princess. Furthermore, the storyline of our game is to win the princess heart back by selecting the right gift after discovering the princess.

# Notable Contributions

3. Designed game mechanisms including items collection behavior, split-and-merge tools, and the effect of growing flowers to increase players' immersive experience
